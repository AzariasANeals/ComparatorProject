This is my ComparableProject.

This program will allow you to create a Student and assign it an ID, name, and gpa.

There is a Student class that will implement the Comparable interface and has a 
compareTo method that will let you compare students based on their gpa. You can then
add these students to the Student array and then sort them and display them. They will be sorted
by their GPAs in ascending order.

In order to run this program first head over to the Main class and create a new Student array
and give it a size. Then populate this array with students (ID, Name, and GPA). Then simply 
use Arrays.sort to sort them and a for-each loop to display the array. 

An example of this is shown in the Main class.
